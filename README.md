tricky problems, but smart solutions for Computational Chemistry

These are some of the main codes I have used to solve common problems I've come to face while working with Gaussian, Amber and NAMD. They have saved me a lot of time and effort, so I hope they will be somehow useful for you too! :)

Enjoy!
